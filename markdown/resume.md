Experience
----------

**MS Thesis (2022-Present)**  

:    **Emergence of classicality in resource theories**
	
	*Project Guide - Dr. Manabendra Nath Bera, DPS, IISER Mohali*

	* Understanding some results about classicality in multi-partite channels with large output spaces.
	* Analyzing these results in context of resource theory of coherence, symmetric channels.
	* Hope to provide some answers about quantum darwinism and distribution of timing information to many parties.

**Fall Semester 2021** 

:     **Understanding Fermi's two atom problem using QIT**
	
	*Project Guide - Dr. Manabendra Nath Bera, DPS, IISER Mohali*

	* Reviewed literature to understand the controversy around the problem, and Hegerfeldt's recent arguments.

	* Reviewed the causality literature in quantum information focussing on the classical paper by Beckman et al.  

	* Tried to understand causality violations in lattice systems.

**Summer 2021**  

: 	**Symmetry and Quantum Information Theory**

	*Project Guide - Dr. Manabendra Nath Bera, DPS, IISER Mohali*
	
	* Reviewed  literature on the resource theory of reference frames andasymmetry. 

	* Presented the paper on extension of Noether's Theorem using QRT of asymmetry, and entropic conditions for state transformations. 

	* Tried to understand asymmetry in many-body systems.

**Summer 2020** 

:      **QIT Methods to study neutrino oscillations**

	  *Project Guide - Dr. Subhashish Banerjee, DPS, IIT Jodhpur*

	* Peer reviewed a paper with my advisor on entropic uncertainty relation in neutrino oscillations
	* Reviewed literature on LGtI inequalities for studying Neutrino/Meson systems.

**Summer 2019** 

: 	**Review of computational methods to study Schrodinger's Equation**
	
	*Project Guide - Dr. Ambresh Shivaji, DPS, IISER Mohali*
